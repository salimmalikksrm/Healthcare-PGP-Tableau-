### Description:

NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.

The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.
 

Dataset Description:

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more.

Variables				Description

Glucose				Plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure			Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness			Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin				Two hour serum insulin
